Connect Four using minimax with alpha-beta pruning

Minimax algorithm is popular in game theory and commonly used in two-player games. Alpha-beta pruning is an optimization technique for the minimax algorithm, which aims to decrease the number of nodes evaluated by the search tree.
Here, the "simple" notebook contains the fundamental implementation of the game while the "pygame" notebook contains a more user-friendly version.
